RateMyProfessor crawler takes in 1 command line argument.
This is the name of the file from which to draw faculty names.
Right now, the crawler works based on the assumption that the file is EECS_Dept_Salary.txt.
I will have to rework the implementation slightly if this file is changed or we decide to use a different one.
It also assumes that the file is located in the same directory as the crawler.
