## Abstract

This repository contains code that our team wrote for EECS 486: Information Retrieval final project during the Winter 2019. 
Our goal was to predict University of Michigan EECS faculty salaries based on a variety of data points including: official
title with the university, research involvement, years of experience, and a variety of other pieces of data. To generate a
salary prediction for each professor, our team trained a neural network on datasets pooled from several sources. One of
which is the FOIA record office (pending request) and the other would be in-house data collection by building a web crawler
to index pages relevant to faculty members at U of M, such as their publicly listed LinkedIn profiles.

## Layout/File Structure

In an attempt to add some organization to this repository, we've broken our project up into various directories. The naming
conventions that we have chosen to use should be fairly self explanatory, but in case not, we've chosen to provide the
following descriptions for each directory:

### GoldStandardCrawler

### LinkedInCrawler

### RateMyProfessorCrawler

### SalaryReleaseData

### Presentation

### NeuralNetwork

### Data

### Checkpoints

## Software

Below you will find information on how to run the various Python scripts that our team wrote for data collection and creating our neural network.
