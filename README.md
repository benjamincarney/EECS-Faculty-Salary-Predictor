## Abstract



## Layout/File Structure

In an attempt to add some organization to this repository, we've broken our project up into various directories. The naming
conventions that we have chosen to use should be fairly self explanatory, but in case not, we've chosen to provide the
following descriptions for each directory:

### GoldStandardCrawler

### LinkedInCrawler

### RateMyProfessorCrawler

### SalaryReleaseData

### Presentation

### NeuralNetwork

### Data

### Checkpoints

## Software

Below you will find information on how to run the various Python scripts that our team wrote for data collection and creating our neural network.
